## Prerequisites

First install **rust** using **rustup**:

We also need **cargo-script** to be able to run our example code. You
can install it with:
```
cargo install cargo-script
```

And you can clone this repository to have access to the slides and example code.
```
git clone https://github.com/MrPicklePinosaur/rust_workshop
```

## Running example code

The code for each slide can be found in the `code/` directory. We can run it using **cargo-script**.
```
cargo script code/1.rs
```
